开头术语: Hi everyone, please try to think one scenario
介绍情景:
A person, who is getting burnned by something, has been sent into one hospital immediately.
However, he still missed the perfect time for the medical treatment, 
	because a lot of time is wasted when the doctor is trying to analysizing his burn wounds.
转场：
The situation mentioned above, is just my project is going to solve such difficulties.
说Project Definition

第一页开场:
First of all, I just would like to introduce the workflow of our algorithm.
从左往右，运用手势，陈述算法的流程。其中，对于中间卷积的描述如下：
In the middle step, we add mathematical transformation for certain block of pixels.
Such transformation would deliever important information which is helpful for the algorithm to make judgement, judgement of which burn type.
We call this process feature extraction

第二页开场：
After introducing the workflow, I m going to show you how exactly we are going to achieve it...
介绍 迁移学习的时候要说:
For building better algorithm, we need to involve some other popular topics of deep learning, which is....
Basically, we will use a pre-trained model to see if we can get better solution
介绍完流程要说：
There are 6 procedures, we need to do it over and over again until we get satisfied with the model

第四页， 开场
Before the conclusion, I would like to talk about some previous researches
First,
Second,
